### About me ðŸ˜„

I am currently a Postdoc Scientist in [Powell Lab](https://www.garvan.org.au/about-us/people/jospow) at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research. My current research is focused on identifying the genetic control of gene expression variability at the single-cell level. To achieve this goal, I am developing novel statistical methods for single-cell eQTL mapping and applying them to the [OneK1K](https://onek1k.org/about) cohort which contains gene expression profiles of 1.2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ~1,000 individuals. This work would help to understand how genetic variants contribute to gene expression regulation at the single-cell level. I will also lead the work on gene regulatory network inference and multi-omics integration for the [TenK10K](https://www.bio-itworld.com/news/2022/06/08/genetic-control-of-autoimmune-disease-mapped-to-cellular-level) cohort, the extended version of OneK1K.
