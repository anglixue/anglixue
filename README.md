### About me ðŸ˜„

I am currently a Postdoc Scientist and inaugural [NHMRC Investigator Fellow](https://www.garvan.org.au/news-resources/news/garvan-researchers-secure-nhmrc-investigator-grants) in [Powell Lab](https://www.garvan.org.au/about-us/people/jospow) at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research/University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. My current research is focused on developing new computational methods to understand the genetic control of gene expression variability at the single-cell level. I am also leading the multi-omics pillar in [TenK10K cohort](https://www.garvan.org.au/news-resources/news/international-partnership-to-map-50-million-human-cells-and-uncover-genetic-fingerprints-of-disease) which aim to infer novel gene regulatory networks by integrating single-cell multi-omics data at population-scale.
